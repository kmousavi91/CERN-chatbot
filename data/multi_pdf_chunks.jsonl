The LHC is presently being constructed in the already\nexisting 27-km LEP tunnel in the Geneva region. It will yield head-on collisions of two pro-\nton (ion) beams of 7 TeV (2.75 TeV per nucleon) each, with a design luminosity of 1034cm\u00002s\u00001\n(1027cm\u00002s\u00001). This paper provides a description of the design and construction of the CMS detec-\ntor. CMS is installed about 100 metres underground close to the French village of Cessy, between\nLake Geneva and the Jura mountains.\nThe prime motivation of the LHC is to elucidate the nature of electroweak symmetry break-"}

The experimental study of the\nHiggs mechanism can also shed light on the mathematical consistency of the Standard Model at\nenergy scales above about 1 TeV . Various alternatives to the Standard Model invoke new symme-\ntries, new forces or constituents. Furthermore, there are high hopes for discoveries that could pave\nthe way toward a uniﬁed theory. These discoveries could take the form of supersymmetry or extra\ndimensions, the latter often requiring modiﬁcation of gravity at the TeV scale. Hence there are\nmany compelling reasons to investigate the TeV energy scale.\nThe LHC will also provide high-energy heavy-ion beams at energies over 30 times higher\nthan at the previous accelerators, allowing us to further extend the study of QCD matter under"}

This problem clearly becomes more severe when\nthe response time of a detector element and its electronic signal is longer than 25 ns. The effect of\nthis pile-up can be reduced by using high-granularity detectors with good time resolution, resulting\nin low occupancy. This requires a large number of detector channels.

These are fermions, which are the building blocks\nof ordinary matter, and gauge bosons, which are the carriers of the electroweak (EW) and\nstrong forces. In addition, the SM postulates the existence of a quantum ﬁeld responsible for\nthe generation of the masses of fundamental particles through a phenomenon known as the\nBrout–Englert–Higgs mechanism. This ﬁeld, known as the Higgs ﬁeld [1–3], interacts with SM\nparticles, giving them mass, as well as with itself.

The electromagnetic and weak\ninteractions are uniﬁed in the electroweak theory. Although the predictions of the SM have\nbeen extensively conﬁrmed, the question of how the W and Z gauge bosons acquire mass whilst\nthe photon remains massless is still open.\nNearly ﬁfty years ago it was proposed [1–6] that spontaneous symmetry breaking in gauge\ntheories could be achieved through the introduction of a scalar ﬁeld.

The interactions\nof the Higgs boson with the electroweak gauge bosons and charged fermions belonging to the\nthird generation of the SM have been observed, with coupling strengths consistent with the\nSM predictions [4–17]. The Yukawa couplings of the Higgs boson to fermions of the ﬁrst and\nsecond generation, however, have yet to be established experimentally. The SM predicts that\nthe strengths of the couplings of the Higgs boson to fermions are proportional to the fermion\nmasses [18–21]. Consequently, the branching fractions of the Higgs boson to fermions of the\nﬁrst and second generation are expected to be small, and their measurement at hadron colliders\nis challenging.
